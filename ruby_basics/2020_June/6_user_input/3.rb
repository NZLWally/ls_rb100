# Write a program that asks the user whether they want the program to print "something", then print it if the user enters y. Otherwise, print nothing.

# Examples:

# $ ruby something.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# y
# something

# $ ruby something.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# n

# $ ruby something.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# help

puts '>> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)'
answer = gets.chomp
puts 'something' if answer == 'y'

# What happens if you type Y (in uppercase) instead of y in response to the prompt?

# "Y" is different to "y" so nothing will be printed

# This is a bad user experience: when obtaining input from a user, you should almost always allow both uppercase and lowercase entries. Can you modify this program so that it prints "something" if the user enters Y or y?

puts '>> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)'
answer = gets.chomp
puts 'something' if answer.downcase == 'y'
